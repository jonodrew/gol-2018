# Conway's Game of Life

After Global Day of Code Retreat 2018, the Game of Life problem was bothering me. It stuck in my mind, so I've 
spent about half a day more working on it and produced some code I'm pleased with. The example I provide is trivial, but 
I'm confident it would work with larger grids and starting states. Or rather, because I've written this test-first, the 
tests are confident.

Right now, the script has to have the initial state and size hard-coded.
